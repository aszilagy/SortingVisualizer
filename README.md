This website allows for a visualization of different types of sorting algorithms given an array of N size.

## Takeaways
* This app requires understanding of how JavaScript canvas drawings work for dynamic visualization.
* Understanding of how to implement different types of sorting methods is also required in order to fully implement the visualization.

**Note:** This is a personal application not designed for commercial or widespread use. The code needs improvement and this is an initial draft of the application.
